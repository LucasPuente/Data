# Data
This is where I stash data sets that I've collected / organized, so that the general public can use them as they see fit. Attribution is not required, but appreciated. If you post online, please cite [@lucaspuente](https://twitter.com/lucaspuente).

## File Descriptions

### County Seats.csv
A file containing the county seats in all 3,143 counties in the US, along with their FIPS codes. This data was scrapped from Wikipedia on January 26, 2017.

### State-SF.Rda
A file containing polygons for all 50 states in the US. This data is stored as tibble with simple featues. Note: the size and location Alaska and Hawaii have been modified (following [these guidelines](https://github.com/wmurphyrd/fiftystater/blob/master/data-raw/make_mapfile.R)) to allow easy plotting of all 50 states at once. 

### US-Counties-SF.Rda
